The CAS website has some good historic insurance loss data sets for use in the ChainLadder package.  This study uses the CAS data to access the accuracy of the different ChainLadder reserving functions.

## The data

The CAS data sets include insrance loss data from 

```{r packages_data}
library(ChainLadder) # install.packages("ChainLadder")
library(casdata) # devtools::install_github("merlinoa/casdata")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
